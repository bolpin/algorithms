// --- Directions
//   Implement Conway's Game of Life for an M x N input array
//   of 1s and 0s
//
//   Rules:
// Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
// Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
// Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
// Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
